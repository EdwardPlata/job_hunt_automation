Though we are a startup, our investors have given us a multi-year runway.<br /><br />Our agent team is small, with just two developers. This hire should be an experienced self-starter that can make an impact on our product development. We aren't interested in someone that just wants to work down a list of pre-defined tasks. Our ideal candidate loves working on products and will help shape the direction of ours. We're going to be improving this product for years and want someone to come on this journey with us.<br /><br />We really like the Basecamp philosophy and try to make sure that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be crazy at work. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask that you work weekends, or late into the night. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind if you need to leave for an appointment in the middle of the day. We understand that software development doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen for 8 hours straight and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about counting time in the chair.
